		<h1>Welcome to Maria's Chapter 2 Test</h1>
		<p>This is where Maria tests all the structural and semantic markups she learns in Chapter 2 of <cite>HTML & CSS</cite> by Jon Duckett.</p>
	<br / ><br / >


		<h2>Maria's Headings Test</h2>
		<h1><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> Maria's Level 1 Heading</h1>
		<h2><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> Maria's Level 2 Heading</h2>
		<h3><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> Maria's Level 3 Heading</h3>
		<h4><code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> Maria's Level 4 Heading</h4>
		<h5><code>&lt;h5&gt;</code> Maria's Level 5 Heading</h5>
		<h6><code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> Maria's Level 6 Heading</h6>
		<p>Headings are structual markups in HTML. According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>HTML has six "levels" of headings:</p>
			<p><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is used for main headings</p>
			<p><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> is used for subheadings</p>
			<p>If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> is used, and so on...</p>
			<p>Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element is the largest, and the contents of an <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> element is the smallest. The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of their text in their browsers. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.</p>

		<h2>Maria's Paragraphs Test</h2>
		<p>Maria is learning HTML currently. So far, so good. :)</p>
		<p>Maria is excited to learn more. She thinks she will be very successful. :))))</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is a structural markup in HTML. According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>
			<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text. For example, a book may have chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under each heading there will be one or more paragraphs.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Duckett continues:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag.</p>
			<p>By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it an any subsequent paragraphs.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Bold Test</h2>
		<p>Maria learned how to make <b>Maria</b> appear bold.</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element is another structural markup. Some descriptions may include <b>key features</b> in bold. According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element does not imply any additional meaning.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Italic Test</h2>
		<p>Maria learned how to make <i>Maria</i> appear italic.</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element is another structural markup. According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content--such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Superscript and Subscript Test</h2>
		<p>Maria learned how to turn <sup>Maria</sup> into a superscript. Maria also learned how to turn <sub>Maria</sub> into a subscript.</p>
		<p>Superscripts are used for date suffices or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power. Subscripts are used to indicate footnotes or chemical formulas.</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> element is for superscripts and the <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> element is for subscripts.</p>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's White Space Test</h2>
		<p>Maria is drifting away from Earth.</p>
		<p>Maria	       is drifting away from Earth.</p>
		<p>Maria is drifting away from 

			Earth.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.</p>
			<p>When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as <b>white space collapsing</b></p>
			<p>You will often see that web page authors take advantage of white space collapsing to indent their code in order to make it easier to follow.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Line Breaks Test</h2>
		<p>Maria<br />gets one hundred tons heavier every day<br />due to falling space dust.<br />lolol</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tag breaks up a paragraph element and is a type of empty element.</p>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Horizontal Rules Test</h2>
		<p>Maria is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>Maria is bigger than all the other planets combined.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>To create a break between themes--such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play--you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code> tag.</p>
			<p>There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as <b>empty elements</b> and they are written differently.</p>
			<p>An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is a good habit to get into.</p>

		<h2>Maria's Strong Test</h2>
		<p><strong>Beware:</strong> Maria operates in this area.</p>
		<p>This Maria has many small pieces and is <strong>not suitable for children under five years old.</strong></p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element is a type of semantic markup.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The use of the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.</p>
			<p>By default, browsers will show the contents of a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element in bold.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Emphasis Test</h2>
		<p>I <em>think</em> Maria was the first.</p>
		<p>I think <em>Maria</em> was the first.</p>
		<p>I think Maria was the <em>first</em>.</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element is another type of semantic markup.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of the sentence.</p>
			<p>By default browsers will show the contents of an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element in italic.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Quotations Test</h2>
		<blockquote cite="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki">
			<p>Did you know that poisonous potatoes are intentionally designed to be uncompostable?</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As Maria said, <q>Some people speak in crazy talk. Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p>
		<p>There are two commonly used quotation elements in HTML; again, these are another form of semantic markups.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is still used inside the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element.</p>
			<p>Browsers tend to indent the contents of the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element, however you should not use the element to indent a piece of text--rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.</p>
			<p>The <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes arouond the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element, however Internet Explorer does not--therefore many people avoid using the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element.</p>
			<p>Both elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about the source of the quotation.<p/>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Abbreviations and Acronyms Test</h2>
		<p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Maria Hester is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.</p>
		<p><acronym title="Maria Be">THICC</acronym> do some crazy space stuff.</p>
		<p>The <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;acronym&gt;</code> elements are semantic markups, and both use title attributes to specify the full term. Moving forward in HTML5, the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element is used for both abbreviations and acronyms.</p>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Citations Test</h2>
		<p><cite>Worship The Kitty</cite> by Maria Hester has sold over ten million copies worldwide.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.</p>
			<p>In HTML5, cite should not really be used for a person's name--but it was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are likely to continue to use it.</p>
			<p>Browers will render the content of a <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element in italics.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Definitions Test</h2>
		<p>A <dfn>Maria</dfn> is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance.</p>
			<p>The <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.</p>
			<p>Some browsers show the content of the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> element in italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Author Details Test</h2>
		<address>
			<p><a href="mailto:maria.e.hester@gmail.com">maria.e.hester@gmail.com</a></p>
			<p>4055 S Jason St, Englewood, CO 80110</p>
			<p>+1 (707) 834-1666</p>
		</address>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.</p>
			<p>It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.</p>
			<p>Browsers often display the content of the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element in italics.</p>
			<p>You may also be interested in something called the hCard microformat for adding physical address information to your markup.</p>
		</blockquote>
	<br /><br />


		<h2>Maria's Changes to Content Test</h2>
		<p>It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> idea Maria had ever had.</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element can show text that has been deleted from it.</p>
			<p>The content of a <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> element is usually underlined, while the content of a <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element usually has a line through it.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Maria's Super Badass Laptop Computer:</p>
		<p><s>Was $666</s></p>
		<p>Now only $999,995</p>
		<p>According to Jon Duckett in <cite>HTML & CSS</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).</p>
			<p>Visually the content of a <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> element will usually be displayed with a line through the center.</p>
			<p>Older versions of HTML had a <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> element for the content that was underlined, but this is being phased out.</p>
