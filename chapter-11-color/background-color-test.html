		<h1>Maria Biology</h1>
		<h2>The Composition of Maria</h2>
		<p>Almost anything can be found in Maria. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important components of Maria that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.</p>
