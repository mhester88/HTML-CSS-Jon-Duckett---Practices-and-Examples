		<p>This is one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich and filling meal.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb chicken thigh (skinless and boneless), cubed</li>
			<li>Marinade</li>
				<ul>
					<li>soy sauce, nama shoyu, or coconut aminos</li>
					<li>fish sauce</li>
					<li>honey, agave nectar, or date syrup (optional, but recommended)</li>
					<li>black pepper (smoked, preferred)</li>
					<li>Aleppo chili flakes</li>
				</ul>
			<li>1 tbsp ghee (additional 1 tbsp may be needed later)</li>
			<li>2 large carrots, chopped</li>
			<li>1 head broccoli, chopped</li>
			<li>Â½ small red cabbage, chopped</li>
			<li>1 package Myojo Japanese Yakisoba in Curry Flavor</li>
			<li>Garnish (optional): sesame seeds, scallions, pickled ginger, and/or dried nori flakes</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Tools</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Medium bowl for marinating</li>
			<li>Medium bowl for holding prepped veggies</li>
			<li>2 large cutting boards</li>
			<li>2 butcher knives</li>
			<li>Large wok</li>
			<li>Tongs</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Method</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the wok. If it's carbon steel, start with a low heat setting and gradual increase the heat until you reach a medium high heat setting.
			<li>Prepare chicken thighs by cutting them into bite-sized cubes.</li>
			<li>Place prepped chicken, soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, black pepper, and chili flakes in a medium bowl and mix well. There should be enough liquid to completely coat the chicken. The ratio between the soy sauce, the fish sauce, and sweetener should be 6:2:1, respectively. Add black pepper and chili flakes to taste. Set aside to marinate while preparing the rest of the meal.</li>
			<li>Chop the carrots and broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Set aside in another medium bowl.</li>
			<li>Chop the red cabbage into bite-sized pieces. Keep separate from the other ingredients.</li>
			<li>Add 1 tbsp of ghee to the wok and coat evenly.</li>
			<li>Add chicken to the wok and cook thoroughly, flipping occasionally. Remove from wok and set aside.</li>
			<li>Add carrots and broccoli to the wok and cook until soft but still crisp, stirring occasionally.</li>
			<li>Add red cabbage and stir all vegetables together. Cook for a few more minutes.</li>
			<li>Add chicken, yakisoba noodles, and seasoning to the wok. Stir all the ingredients together until everything is evenly coated and the noodles soften.</li>
			<li>Serve hot, add garnish if desired.</li>
